# Prompt Improvement Template

This template helps you systematically improve your AI prompts through collaborative feedback. Instead of guessing what makes a good prompt, you work with the AI to identify gaps and optimize for better results.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Start with a working prompt**: Don't aim for perfection initially—develop something that works through conversation
2. **Use this template**: Copy the template below and provide your existing prompt
3. **Answer the questions**: The AI will ask targeted questions to understand your needs
4. **Iterate together**: Usually takes 4-5 rounds of back-and-forth
5. **Get the improved version**: The AI will rewrite your prompt incorporating all insights

## The Template

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title="prompt-improvement-template.md">
{PromptTemplate}
</CodeBlock>

## Why This Works

This approach is effective because:

- **Collaborative**: You're not guessing—you're working with your AI collaborator
- **Systematic**: The template ensures all important aspects are covered
- **Iterative**: Multiple rounds of questions reveal blind spots
- **Practical**: Based on actual use rather than theoretical best practices
